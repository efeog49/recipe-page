        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
                You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
                the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
                middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
